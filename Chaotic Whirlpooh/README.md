# Charotic Whirlpool
Simulation of the behavior of a packet of water (point mass) inside a chaotic system - a blinking vortex, through classical equations of motion. The chaotic nature of the system arises as two point masses placed 'very close' to one another begin to exhibit totally different behaviors after a certain time period.
